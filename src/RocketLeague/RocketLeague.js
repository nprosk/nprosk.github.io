        From starting out on the lowest club team freshman year to finally making varsity in my junior year, my journey through Rocket League has been a steady climb. It wasn't always easy â€“ there were plateaus and setbacks along the way. After becoming a varsity sub sophomore year, I thought I had my shot at the main team, but a new grad student proved too tough to beat in tryouts. Instead of giving up, I kept grinding. Finally, next semester, my perseverance paid off, and I earned my spot on the varsity team. Through it all, some of my closest friendships have formed, making Rocket League not just a game, but a cornerstone of my college experience.
